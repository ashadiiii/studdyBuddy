      "Based on the provided input, here's an analysis of the requirements and objectives for preparing for the Calculus final exam:\n",
      "\n",
      "**I. Requirements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Requirement 1: Comprehensive Content Coverage**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:**  The user needs to cover all topics that will be tested on the final exam. This is the foundational requirement for success.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** High\n",
      "*   **Requirement 2: Problem-Solving Proficiency**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** Calculus is a problem-solving-based subject.  The user needs to be able to apply concepts to solve a variety of problems.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** High\n",
      "*   **Requirement 3: Exam-Specific Strategies**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** Understanding the exam format, types of questions, and time management strategies is crucial for performing well under pressure.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** Medium\n",
      "*   **Requirement 4: Error Analysis and Correction**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** Identifying and correcting weaknesses is key to improvement. The user needs to understand where they are making mistakes and how to avoid them.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** Medium\n",
      "*   **Requirement 5: Time Management**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** Given the deadline, the user needs to allocate sufficient time to each topic and practice effectively.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** High\n",
      "*   **Requirement 6: Resource Identification**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:**  Identifying and gathering necessary resources such as textbooks, notes, practice exams, and online materials is essential.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** Medium\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Objectives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Objective 1: Master Core Calculus Concepts**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** Develop a deep understanding of fundamental concepts like limits, derivatives, integrals, and their applications.  This is essential for tackling complex problems.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** High\n",
      "*   **Objective 2: Improve Problem-Solving Speed and Accuracy**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** The user needs to solve problems quickly and accurately to maximize their score on the exam.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** High\n",
      "*   **Objective 3: Identify and Address Weak Areas**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** Pinpointing specific areas of weakness allows for focused practice and improvement.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** High\n",
      "*   **Objective 4: Simulate Exam Conditions**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** Practice with mock exams under timed conditions to build confidence and improve performance under pressure.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** Medium\n",
      "*   **Objective 5: Achieve a Desired Score on the Final Exam**\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** The ultimate goal is to perform well on the exam and achieve a satisfactory grade. While not explicitly stated, this is the implicit and overarching objective.\n",
      "    *   **Priority:** High\n",
      "*   **Objective 6: Effective use of study time**\n",
      "     *   **Rationale:** Since the user is 17 and has a university education level, it is possible that he/she has other academic demands. For that reason, this objective is important.\n",
      "     *   **Priority:** Medium\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Gaps, Ambiguities, and Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Gap:** The description is empty. There are no specific requirements, preferences or conditions.\n",
      "*   **Recommendation 1:** Clarify the specific topics covered in the Calculus course. This will allow for a more focused and efficient study plan.\n",
      "*   **Recommendation 2:**  Inquire about the exam format (e.g., multiple choice, free response, calculator allowed?). Knowing the format helps tailor the preparation strategy.\n",
      "*   **Recommendation 3:** Determine if there are any past exams available for practice. These are invaluable resources for understanding the types of questions that may be asked.\n",
      "*    **Recommendation 4:**  Inquire about the specific goals of the user. (e.g., passing the exam, getting a specific grade).\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these gaps and recommendations, a more effective and personalized study plan can be created.\n",

Add a task to review the exam syllabus and past papers to identify common question types and allocate time for each section.\n",
      "2.  **More Emphasis on Error Analysis and Correction:** While the plan includes identifying weak areas, it could benefit from a more structured approach to error analysis (Requirement 4). Modify the \"Focus on weak areas\" task to include specific error analysis techniques (e.g., categorizing errors, identifying patterns).\n",
      "3.  **Consider Adding Milestones:** If the user wants to achieve a specific grade, it could be beneficial to add a milestone to assess the progress after reviewing the fundamental concepts.\n",

      "    *   Priority: HIGH (Critical for success)\n",
      "*   **Requirement 3: Utilize visual learning resources.**\n",
      "    *   Rationale: The user expresses a preference for visual learning, indicating that this method is more effective for their comprehension and retention.\n",
      "    *   Priority: MEDIUM (Important for efficient learning)\n",
      "*   **Requirement 4: Incorporate practice tests.**\n",
      "    *   Rationale: Practice tests are essential for familiarizing the user with the exam format, identifying knowledge gaps, and improving test-taking skills.\n",

      "*   **Requirement 5: Schedule study sessions in the evenings and on weekends.**\n",

      "*   **Requirement 6: The study plan needs to be tailored for a high school student.**\n",

      "    *   Priority: HIGH (Critical for success)\n",
      "*   **Objective 2: Improve understanding of complex biological concepts.**\n",
      "    *   Rationale: AP Biology involves understanding intricate processes and mechanisms. The study plan should facilitate the comprehension of these complex concepts.\n",
      "    *   Priority: HIGH (Critical for success)\n",
      "*   **Objective 3: Develop effective test-taking strategies.**\n",

      "*   **Recommendation:** The user should specify what aspects of genetics and cell biology they struggle with the most. This will allow for a more focused and effective review.\n",
      "*   **Recommendation:** Given the short timeframe (approximately 2 weeks), the study plan needs to be highly focused and efficient. Prioritization of topics and use of time-saving study techniques are crucial.\n",
